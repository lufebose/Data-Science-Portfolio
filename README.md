# R-Data-Science-Portfolio
Includes the major Data Science projects that I've created using R Studio 


Project 1: Analyzing Bitcoin (BTC) price while inflation expectations are high
# 
i. Used tidyquant, tidyverse, timetk, lubridate, dplyr ggplot2 to extract, analyze and visualize how BTC has behaved during 2022 when it went below $20,000 

ii. Obtained other time series such as University of Michigan monthly Inflation Expectations from the FRED Website using Tidyquant in order to better understand BTC's downward spiral

iii. Analyzed the bond and currency market by extracting information in an automated way using the Tidyquant Package in R
